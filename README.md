Smart Home Thermostat – Cisco Packet Tracer + API Simulation
Location: San Jose, CA
Duration: August 2023 – December 2023
Role: Developer

Overview
This project simulates a Smart Home Thermostat system designed in Cisco Packet Tracer with integration of a Python-based weather API. The goal was to build a secure, automated, and intelligent environment where internal temperature adjusts based on real-time external weather data fetched via the OpenWeatherMap API.

Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.2+)

- IPv4/IPv6, VLANs, DNS, and Router Configuration

- IoT Device Simulation (Smart Thermostat, HVAC)

- Python (for external API integration)

- OpenWeatherMap API

Key Features
✅ Automatic Temperature Adjustment
Fetches real-time weather data and adjusts the internal thermostat accordingly (heat or cool).

✅ Secure Multi-VLAN Network Design
Separates IoT, admin, and client devices for added security and better traffic flow.

✅ Dual Stack Network (IPv4/IPv6)
Configured 20+ devices using both address protocols for future-ready networking.

✅ API-Based Weather Logic
Simulated Python script mimics IoT behavior using real-world data.

▶️ How It Works
Network Topology Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer:

- Central router connects to a Tier 3 ISP simulation.

- VLANs split IoT devices from user/admin networks.

- Thermostat and HVAC connected via IoT protocol (simulated).

- Python Script pulls temperature from OpenWeatherMap and decides:

- If temp > 26°C: Turn on cooling system

- If temp < 18°C: Turn on heater

- Otherwise: Do nothing (ideal temp)
